# Trap models and versions
This integration should work with traps that has been provisioned with the VictorPest app. Please create an [issue](https://github.com/toreamun/victorsmartkill-homeassistant/issues/new/choose) if you have trouble with your trap. Please see the wiki if you are interested in details about the [hardware](https://github.com/toreamun/victorsmartkill-homeassistant/wiki/Hardware).

It is very helpfull if you can check the [list of models](https://github.com/toreamun/victorsmartkill-homeassistant/wiki/Hardware#list-of-known-traps-versions) and update the list if you have an unlisted trap or version.
